Videos are records of HCA simulations. 

Experimental configurations for each simmulation are indicated in the file name / testID.

A list of all Test IDs is available from hca/data/resultsSummary.xlsx file

E.g., L3-T1v1.mp4 records a 3-level HCA with configurations indicate in T1v1 
--> see hca/data/resultsSummary.xlsx file for this test's configurations;
--> see hca/data/3L-T1v1.xlsx file for graphs and analysis.
