The _data_ folder is organised as follows:

-- raw-data folder: contains raw data collected during experiments; each experiment has its own folder 
(e.g.  L3_T1-V1_01-05Th_1-1-1Sm_stkCo-oscBo-dedCr_500iter)

-- *.xlsx files: provide graphs and analysis of data from selected experiments 
(e.g. 3L-T1v1.xlsx analyses experiment T1v1 from a 3-level HCA, where the raw data is available from the folder exemplified above)

-- resultsSummary.xlsx: provides an overview of a more extensive set of selected experiments
(raw data may or may not be available for all experiments summarised here  -- it will formatted and uploaded progressively).
